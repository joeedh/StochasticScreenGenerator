Stochastic Screen Generator (for printing, stippling, etc)
==========================================

[Click here to try it out](http://joeedh.github.io/StochasticScreenGenerator/bluenoise9.html)

This little web app generates stochastic (blue noise) screens
for digital halftoning/stippling.  It has four methods:

* Dart:  Classic, progressive dart throwing.  Generates
  the highest quality masks.
  
* SPH: SPH fluid method.  Not quite as good as dart, and 
  a bit harder to control.  Is much slower at higher resolutions.
  
* Jitter: A very simple randomlized hexagonal grid method.  Produces
  the worst results
  
* AA: AA patterns, optimized to have blue noise properties via the SPH
      method.  Based on papers by Abdalla G. M. Ahmed, but modified to use skewed 
      grids and a dynamic threshold limit instead of a fixed one.

Usage

What are AA Patterns?
=====================

![example image](http://joeedh.github.io/StochasticScreenGenerator/examples/AA_Illustration.png "Example")

AA Patterns, invented by Abdalla G. M. Ahmed, are generated by intersecting the vertices of
one grid with (half of) the cells of another.  The resulting patterns are highly controllable;
they can be aperiodic, or they can periodic to within a certain interval.

My innovation here is progressive sampling (used for halftone/stippling, importance sampling
in ray tracers, etc).

I get the best progressive sampling I can by skewing the grid, and then I apply an SPH fluid
method (a simplified version of the SPH mode, actually).  

The SPH method works by building a hiearchy of fluids.  Each fluid level can "see" levels that
are coarser than it is, but not ones that are more dense.  This was my first attempt, and later
I also tried the Weighted Sample Removal paper, but then it dawned on me that the SPH method 
works in basically the same way, but works better with AA patterns.

Using with Blue Noise Stippler
==============================
To test the generated masks, you can use [this stippling app of mine](http://joeedh.github.io/BlueNoiseStippling/bluenoise6.html).
[Here's a direct link](https://github.com/joeedh/BlueNoiseStippling) to the app itself.

Click on the "Save To Cache" button on the lower-right side of the screen.  You should see a 
message like "saving blue noise mask to local storage."  You should be able to use the new mask
in the stippling app.
